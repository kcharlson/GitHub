        <p>So let’s set some ground rules out first when it comes to asking for help. As students our gut reaction to instantly ask for help when we get stuck, specially when we are trying things for the first time while being stressed out. It’s alright. Before you ask for help though you should ask yourself these questions:</p>

        <br>
        <strong>Have a spent at least ten minutes, trying to solve it myself?</strong><br><p>Sometimes just reviewing your code can help you find what’s causing your troubles. For example, it’s easy to overlook a missing semi-colon or missing period, when you first look over your code. Take a few looks over it first before you panic or stress.</p><br>
        <strong>Have you checked the inspector?</strong><br><p>The inspector is (in a way) a bridge of communication between you and the browser. Within the console you will see how the browser is reading your code. This can be helpful for those moments when your website is acting up, displaying things the way you didn't expect, or if items are start-up missing. The inspector will also alert you to any errors as well!</p>
    </div>

        <br>
        <strong>Have you googled your problem?</strong><br><p>As modern developers we are very lucky to have a tool such as Google. You can almost find anything online these days! Thankfully many people have been in the same situation as you, and most of those issues have been solved. Sometimes with a good, and specific Google search you will help yourself find the answer some of your hardest questions before even having to ask the anyone.</p><br>
        <strong>Have you uploaded your code to the server?</strong><br><p>This may or may not solve your problems, but when you upload your site to the server, it makes so much easier to share your code (and problems) with others. The reason being that's it is much easier to troubleshoot live code than a static screenshot.</p>
