    <p>You will find quickly that the inspector is your best friend when it comes to troubleshooting. When first looking at the inspector, it can feel difficult to understand what it is trying to tell you and how you can use this as a tool. That’s okay, being able to understand this tool will quickly become second nature. So what is the inspector? The inspector is a set of advanced developer tools that can be found in most modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.  It is a mode of communication between you and how your browser is reading your code. This can be helpful when you are trying to troubleshoot issues. Also, when the inspector is open, you can also make, and preview, adjustments to your code in a live situation (as an alternative to Bracket’s live preview mode).</p>
    <p>Our friends at Google have created an extensive guide on how to use, and read, Chrome’s inspector. This guide has been linked below. </p>
