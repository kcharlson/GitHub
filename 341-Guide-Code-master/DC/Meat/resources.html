        <p>It’s nearly impossible to know and retain all the information when it comes to coding. Thanks to the internet though, we have access to some of the greatest assets and resources to help us solve and troubleshoot problems, learn and grow, and help us remind important aspects of the trade. Just like while writing a research paper, it’s helpful to have a long list of, go-to, reliable sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="meat_p second" data-content="sectionSecond">
        <p>There’s a reasonable amount of great resources that help teach the industry standard markup, structure, and terms to use within your code. You’re not expected to follow these standards exact within this class because you are just starting out and learning. Despite that though, these general standards are necessary to be aware of and understand as you move forward into Art 342, and future career projects.</p>
        <p>As a heads up, these resources can be more technical, and be filled with developer based language (since that’s their audience). If you feel lost and confused by this language, don’t be afraid to ask, and or, Google it!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="meat_p third" data-content="sectionThird">
        <p>If you want to get some extra practice in or expand your knowledge, there are plenty of free online resources that help teach you general and specific concepts in various fields. These resources allows you to practice in controlled situations, and helps ease you into new concepts without having to worry about breaking your current project.</p>
    </div>
    
     <div class="meat_p fourth" data-content="sectionFourth">
         <p>One of the major questions during the troubleshooting process is where I can go to find reliable answers? Fortunately, that’s an easy question! </p>
         <br>
         <strong>Stack overflow:</strong><br>
         <p>Stackoverflow is an online forum based website that focuses on troubleshooting programming based issues of all kinds and difficulties. Most everyday troubleshooting issues have been discussed and solved in some variation or another on this site.</p>
         <br>
         <strong>Codepen:</strong><br>
         <p>Just like the learning programs discussed in the last slide, Codepen allows you to practice in a controlled situation where you can try new code and ideas without affecting your project. Also, many people have tried and saved working code on the site for others to explore, experiment and try out on their own. </p>
         <br>
         <strong>w3Schools:</strong><br>
         <p>w3schools is a great learning tool, but can also help with troubleshooting tool as well thanks to its excellent descriptions of how sets of code work, and great working tutorials. </p>
